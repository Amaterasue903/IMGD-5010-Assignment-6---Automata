## Eternal life

I spent a loooong time working to implement the game of life. This was like the first big thing I tried to do on my own and I struggled with it for like a few days before caving into watching the video and following aloong to a degree. Without it I don't frankly think I would've finished it.

But for my main change I added the ability to click to make a square alive, this allows for more complex shapes and patterns to form and theoretically eternal life. It was a interesting addition even if it was not a large one but creates the idea of eternal life. With this you can control on your own game of life to a degree sprouting more where you please. From this you can proabably derive a lot of weird interpretations on life and our influence on it but im not the most philosophical. I hope you enjoy I took quite a bit of time on it so im quite proud even if its not grand.
